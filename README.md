# Object Detection with YOLOV1

#### This is an Implementation of Object Detection using YOLO V1 trained on Pascal VOC Dataset with over 85 Million Parameters.

Detection List = ['aeroplane', 'bicycle', 'bird', 'boat', 'bottle',
                     'bus', 'car', 'cat', 'chair', 'cow', 'diningtable',
                     'dog', 'horse', 'motorbike', 'person', 'pottedplant',
                     'sheep', 'sofa', 'train', 'tvmonitor']

#### This model can detect only the objects listed in the above detection list.

#### THE MODEL MAY SOMETIMES PRODUCE INCORRECT PREDICTIONS & NEEDS TO TRAINED FOR MORE EPOCHS TO INCREASE ACCURACY.

#### Images are resized to 448x448 since the model accepts a fixed size image as input.

#### Each bounding box displays the object name it has detected and the probability of an object being present inside the bounding box.

#### (GPU RECOMMENDED FOR RUNNING THE MODEL)
